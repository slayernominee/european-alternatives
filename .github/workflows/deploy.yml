# DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
#
# dist/ is gitignored so developers never commit build artifacts manually.
# This workflow handles it: on every push to main it builds the project,
# force-commits dist/ back to main (with [skip ci] to avoid loops), and
# then deploys to GitHub Pages.
#
# Hostinger auto-pulls from main and serves static files from dist/.
# GitHub Pages gets the same build via the upload-pages-artifact action.
#
# TL;DR: just push source changes — dist/ takes care of itself.
