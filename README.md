# European Alternatives

**Discover European and open-source alternatives to US tech giants.**

A community-curated directory that helps you find software and services built in Europe — with privacy, transparency, and digital sovereignty at their core.

> Your data. Your rules. Your continent.

## Why This Exists

Big Tech dominates the tools we use every day — email, cloud storage, messaging, search. Most of these services are US-based, subject to US jurisdiction, and built on business models that treat user data as a product.

Europe has strong privacy laws (GDPR), a growing open-source ecosystem, and talented developers building real alternatives. But finding them is hard. They're scattered across blog posts, Reddit threads, and word of mouth.

**European Alternatives** brings them together in one place. This project exists to:

- **Promote digital sovereignty** — keep your data under European law and jurisdiction
- **Champion privacy-first services** — built with GDPR compliance from the ground up
- **Support open-source software** — transparent, auditable, and community-driven
- **Strengthen the European tech ecosystem** — give visibility to homegrown innovation

This is not about nationalism. It's about choice, transparency, and building a healthier tech landscape.

## Features

- **Browse by category** — Email, Cloud Storage, Messaging, AI, Payments, and 13 more
- **Filter by country, pricing, and open-source status** — find exactly what you need
- **Trust Score (1-10) + vetting status** — transparent scoring with reservations and confidence level
- **Search across all alternatives** — matches names, descriptions, tags, and replaced services
- **Grid and list views** — switch between compact overview and detailed display
- **Shareable category and search filters** — category and search term are stored in the URL for direct linking
- **Responsive design** — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **No tracking, no cookies** — the site itself respects the privacy it advocates for

## Trust Method

Each listing includes:
- Trust Score (1-10)
- Trust Tier (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)
- Trust Confidence (High, Medium, Low)
- Vetting Status (vetted approved, research profile, or vetted rejected)
- Reservations (specific caveats with severity)

Scoring is deterministic and evidence-weighted:
- Rewards European jurisdiction, open-source transparency, and privacy/self-hosting signals
- Applies reservation penalties by severity
- Uses vetted outcomes from `tmp/vetted/*-approved.md` and `tmp/vetted/*-rejected.md` where available
- Keeps non-vetted entries visible with lower confidence so coverage stays broad while certainty stays explicit

Full formula and rationale: `docs/TRUST-METHODOLOGY.md`.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make this project grow. Whether you want to **add an alternative**, **fix a bug**, **improve the design**, or **suggest a new category** — you're welcome here.

See [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide, including:

- How to add a new European alternative (the most common contribution)
- How to contribute code and design changes
- Coding standards and commit conventions
- Design system guidelines

The fastest way to contribute: add or improve an entry in `tmp/european-alternatives-master-research.md` and run `npm run generate:research`.
